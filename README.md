# hello-world-
## This is a simulated run through of my first repository where I am practicing creating a repsository, adding a new branch, creating pull requests, and merging branch with main workspace. 
### PROJECT TITLE ** GITHUB PRACTICE **
* In order to run this I will be adding a new branch to go along with my main branch. I will use my new branch which is titled work_practice to play around with syntax and edit the README. *
